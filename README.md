## Introduction 
Shrink animation buttons refer to buttons in a user interface that, when clicked, animate to a smaller size. This type of animation is often used to provide visual feedback to the user, indicating that the button has been activated or that it is in a "pressed" state. Shrink animation buttons can be used to create a more interactive and engaging user experience.
